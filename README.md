# EndeVOR 2.4

This project is to build a Voron 2.4 from Parts from an Ender-3.  I chose this project because a lot of people have an Ender sitting in the corner that was their first printer, and they feel bad about just letting it go to e-waste.  I was able to build this project using a bunch of spare parts that I had on hand which lowered my cost significantly. I estimate this would cost roughly 300 to 400 U.S. dollars to convert it yourself. The majority of the cost is in the frame and the panels. I've included a CSV of my bill of materials in case that's helpful.

In doing this project I had a number of design goals:  
1.	Make this as close to a stock Voron 2.4 as possible. 
2.	Reuse as many ender parts as possible including the screen, the electronics, the wiring, the motors, and whatever else I could repurpose.  
3.	Print as many pieces as possible in order to reserve cost. This meant using low cost cameras, printed Z chains, and utilizing my zero panels mod to save on hardware. 
4.	There are a few quality of life improvements including sensorless homing, can bus tool head, Nevermore filter, full panels, and lighting.
